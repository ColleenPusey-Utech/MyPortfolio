                <h4>HERO</h4>
                <p><em>"Sometimes, you have to lose everything before you realize what really matters. - Grace"</em></p>
                <p>One of my Favourite scene from Memoirs of a Snail is when Grace finally learns to let go of her past and begins to open up to the world again. This moment shows how strong she truly is after years of lonliness and loss. Memoirs of a Snail is a stop-motion animated film by Adam Elliot, who is known for creating touching stories about imperfect but deeply human characters. What I admire most about Grace is her resilience, she doesn't give up, even when life feels heavy. Her story reminds me that healing takes time and that kindness, both to ourselves and others, is powerful. This inspires me to stay grateful and hopeful, even through hard times. Grace is my hero because she teaches the importance of perserverance, empathy and finding beauty in small, ordinary moments.</p>

                <h3>AI BUSINESSES OF 2025</h3>
                <p> My Favourite ideo from the Ai-based business of 2025 is <b>AI- Based Smart Home Management</b>, which uses artificial intelligence to automate household functions such as lighting, temperature control and security. This technology can be applied in my world by helping me manage energy usage more effieciently by automatically turning of lights when i leave a room, voice-control speakers,lighting and ac, thus reducing electricity costs. Additionally, AI-powered security systems can monitor for unusual activity and alert me in real time, providing greater safety.</p>
                <p><b>Ethical Concerns:</b>Privacy and surveillence are key issues since these systems collect personal information about user's daily activitys. To address this developers and users should ensure strong data encryption, transparency in data collection, and user consent to protect sensitive information.(Thakur et al., 2024)</p>
                <p><b>App Example:</b>Google Home, part of Google Nest ecosystem, which allows users to control household devices via voice or app commands while maintaining privacy protections (Google Store, n.d.)</p>

                <h3>TWELVE PILLARS</h3>
                <h4> Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goaol</h4>
                <p> This chapter teaches the importance of writing down clear, specific goals. It's not just about achieving them but about who you become in the process. I can apply this by setting realistic personal and academic goals and tracking my progress to stay focused.</p>
                <h4>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h4>
                <p>Time is a limited resource, so it must be used wisely. The lesson is to focus on important tasks rather than just urgent ones. I can apply this by organizing my day better and avoiding distractions.</p>
                <h4> Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h4>
                <p>The people around us influence our growth. Surrounding myself with positive, goal-driven individuals can help me stay motivated. I will seek friendships and mentors who push me to be better. </p>
                <h4> Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h4>
                <p> Learning shouldn't stop after school. Continuous personal development leads to long-term success. I plan to keep reading, exploring new skills, and using every experience as a learning opportunity.</p>
